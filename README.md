> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Environments and Worflow templates: the example workflows in this repository template have a hard coded environment of "```demo```" and as such may differ from the environment name entered for your provisioned target bootstrap environment.

> [!NOTE]  
> The target bootstrap environment is created via Terraform and has the protection rule "```Prevent self-review```" disabled for demo purposes (allows you to self approve a deployment).  Enable it for non-demo "best practice" security reasons.  See screenshot below.
